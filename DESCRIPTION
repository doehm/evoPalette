Title: Generate New Colour Palettes Using an Evolutionary Algorithm
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Daniel Oehm
Maintainer: Daniel Oehm <danieloehm@gmail.com>
Description: Taking the next step in choosing the right colour palette. Using colour pickers can be overwhelming and consuming to land
  on the palette you are looking for. evoPalette uses a genetic algorithm allowing users to generate their own colour palettes, either 
  by evolving existing palettes or completely random ones. The Shiny application allows you to easily tweak palettes until you 
  discover the perfect one. Save each new palette you like to a palette box.
